# Mute-Timer
Mute Timer for Windows written in c#

simple timer app for muting system wide sound

option to set a timer or specify a specific hour for muting.

.NET 4.6.2 required !!!


this is a small project i built for a friend who wanted this kind of a tool

also, this is my first programming project, done in one day, finishing it quickly was a priority.

given all that, there's no emphasis on code quality here, yet the code is simple enough.


mute code was copied from here:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/154089/mute-windows-volume-using-c-sharp

i have no idea how it works exactly

feel free to branch, distrubute, use code or whatever else.

also, bugs and request are welcome.
