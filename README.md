# Mute-Timer
Mute Timer for Windows written in c#
simple timer app for muting system wide sound
option to set a timer or specify a specific hour for muting.


this is a small project i built for a friend who wanted this kind of a tool
also, this is my first programming project, done in one day, finishing it quickly was a priority.
given all that, there's no emphasis on code quality here, yet the code is simple enough.


mute code was copied from here:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/154089/mute-windows-volume-using-c-sharp
i have no idea how it works exactly

feel free to branch, distrubute, use code or whatever else.
also, bugs and request are welcome.
